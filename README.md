Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic rock paper scissors game in Python.

How to Play
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter either "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The computer will then randomly choose between those three options.

The winner is determined by the classic rules:

* Rock smashes scissors
* Scissors cut paper
* Paper covers rock
If both players choose the same option, it results in a tie.

The game will keep track of wins and losses. It will ask if you want to play again after each round.
